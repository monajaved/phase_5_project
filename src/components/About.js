                    <p> This application was developed in 2021. The idea was to build a project where users can create location based journals as they travel. Whenever I travelled places with my SO, there were times where we just couldn't remember if we went to this particular place or what exactly did we do there so TA-DAAA! Will continue to work on this project so in the future this can detect your location automatically and you can add a personal note to the pointer whenever convenient.</p>
