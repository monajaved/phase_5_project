Travel Journal app

* sign up/log in page (homepage)
* render google maps 
* the user can click on a location and that should prompt for an entry (heart icon?)
(gotta figure how that information will be saved)

STRETCH GOALS
* add friend functionality
* both users should be able to edit and add a note.

Database

* Journal entry - location based - user name: title, content
* Users - username and password

Models

* Journal entries belong to a user
* Users have many journal entries
